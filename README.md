#Boxing with Ares - An Alternate Realities Project

Team member: Vince Nguyen, Nhi Pham, and Neyva Hernandez

Environment: dark and ominous, yet there is still an indication of hope

Boxing with Ares is an interactive experience that aims to immerse the users in a bloody reality. We focus on creating an environment similar to the one in the movie The Matrix, which is simple yet gives a sense of exploration for the users by interacting with what lies in the scene. Our scene consists of the plain ground with foggy surroundings, the red bloody sky scattered with floating small punching bags, and the main punching bag for interaction. Our basic interaction is punching action with the emphasis on the unexpectedness - doves flying out in different angles, speeds, and positions around the punching bag. While the interaction is analogous for finding hope in the darkest time, it is also open to the usersâ€™ interpretation that hope is escaping their reach, impossible to capture. In either interpretation, this still serves as an alternate reality experience that deals with different manifestations of hope, be it the shining beacon in the darkest of times or the flickering illusion that forever remains out of human reach.
